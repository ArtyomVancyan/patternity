# PATTERNITY

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a deterministic algorithm inspired by the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model of deep learning. Unlike traditional statistical models, this approach leverages the power of pattern recognition to identify and repeat the most similar historical patterns in stock price data, with visualizations inspired by Google Finance day charts.
